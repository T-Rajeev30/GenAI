# GenAI Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my journey as I learn about Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) from scratch.

## Why GenAI?

Generative AI is transforming industries by enabling machines to create text, images, music, and more. I am starting from the basics to build a strong foundation in this exciting field.

## Goals

- Understand core concepts of GenAI
- Explore popular models (e.g., GPT, Diffusion models)
- Gain hands-on experience with frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Build simple GenAI projects

## Learning Resources

- [DeepLearning.AI GenAI Courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
- [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/)
- [Hugging Face Tutorials](https://huggingface.co/learn)

## Progress

I will update this repository with notes, code samples, and project ideas as I advance.
